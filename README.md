## Project Notes

- This App draws a dynamic responsive grid of 0s and 1s, and maps the 1s or positive cells as Hearts.
- When a heart is clicked, it shows the number of hearts connected horizontally and vertically and displays that number in each connected cell which belongs to that group.
- When a user hovers over a cell, all the connected cells are highlighted.
- Users can change the size of the grid and background colours dynamically.

- This project was developed as part of a practical exam intended to demonstrate problem solving and coding skills in a framework of my choice. 

## Project dependencies

- This project was developed with [React js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a base framework.
- React Color picker - [npm install rc-color-picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc-color-picker)
- Live Sass Compiler - VS Code extention to compile SASS

## To Run the Project

- Verify you have node installed (`node --version` to see output)
- Clone or download the project on your local machine
- Install the project dependencies using `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode
- Run `npm run build` to build a production ready version

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
